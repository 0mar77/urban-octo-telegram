## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to help businesses grow by helping them with their marketing
- This project allows them to see what we can provide for them and how that can potentially help them grow
- With this project, we can attract new potential customers by showing what we can do for them
- Through the process of creating this project many things were learned. Such things include the use of semantic HTML, and how to problem solve. 
  When one element was altered, many unintended consequences occurred. The challenge was finding why that was the case, and how to solve the problem.
